### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - Python jukebox with touchcreen inteface
  - Some python scripts that use Discord, so I can throw them on the cloud and interact with them on my phone
  - A display script for attract-mode frontend for arcade emulation (this:https://attractmode.org/)
